Given the values:
x = 2
y = 5 
z = 0

Let's evaluate each expression:
a. x == 2 
This checks if (x) is equal to 2.
(x) is 2, so ( x == 2 ) is true.

b. x!= 5 
This checks if (x) is not equal to 5.
(x) is 2, so (x!= 5) is true.

c. (x!= 5 && y >= 5)
This checks if ( x ) is not equal to 5 and (y)  is greater than or equal to 5.
(x) is 2, which is not equal to 5, so (x!= 5) is true.
(y) is 5, which is greater than or equal to 5, so (y>= 5) is true.
Since both conditions are true, ( x != 5 && y >= 5 ) is true.

d. ( z != 0 || x == 2 )
This checks if ( z ) is not equal to 0 or ( x) is equal to 2.
- ( z ) is 0, so ( z != 0 ) is false.
- ( x ) is 2, so ( x == 2 ) is true.
- Since one of the conditions is true, ( z != 0 || x == 2 ) is true.

e. ( !(y < 10) )
This checks the negation of  y < 10.
- y  is 5, which is less than 10, so  y < 10 is true.
- The negation of true is false, so  !(y < 10) is false.

Summary of results:
- a. x == 2  is true
- b. x != 5  is true
- c. x != 5 && y >= 5 is true
- d. z != 0 || x == 2  is true
- e. !(y < 10) is false

These are the evaluated results for the given expressions with the provided values of x ,  y , and z.
